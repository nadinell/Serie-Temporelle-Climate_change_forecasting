## Project Objective
The primary aim is to analyze climate change through time series forecasting, focusing on temperature data. The project explores forecasting models to predict future trends based on historical climate data.

## Data Description
The dataset used is from the [Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data), which includes global land temperature reports.

## Methodology
The methodology involves:

Data cleaning and preprocessing to address issues like missing values and inconsistent records.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the dataset.
Implementing time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and residual-based models.
## Modeling & Evaluation
The notebook evaluates different forecasting models, comparing them using AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).
